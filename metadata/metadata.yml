readme: | # (optional)
  The punch parsers provided in this packaged are examples based on well known
  log types. 
  
  In general, a parser is simply a single 'parser.punch' function that takes
  care of extracting then normalising the input logs into an ECS compliant 
  document ready to be inserted into Elasticsearch or Opensearch.
  This single package provides several different parsers.
  
  The punchlang programming language provides many advanced functions
  to benefit from grok, key values, csv, and lots of conversions methods
  to easily deal with the most common log fields. In particular
  the samples shown here illustrate how to enrich your documents on the fly using
  external JSON (or CSV) files. 
  
  In addition, the punch SDK and tooling helps you to unit test then package
  a,d deploy your parsers to your running platform.  
  
  The goal of all this is simply to let parser developers focus on writing
  robust and well-tested parsers, ensuring they produce the correct ECS
  output format, and let the platform administrator deploy these parser in the 
  adequate data pipelines. 
  
  If you work with kooker, simply type in 'make upload' to upload your packaged platform
  into the kooker artifact server. You can then execute the sample punchline to
  see it in action.
